# Muscles-Activity-Analysis
This an EMG  (Electromyography) program made by students for students, not made for a medical purpose yet.
This code uses the MATLAB platform to perform itself, we don't know if it cant be used in other languages, but you can try it.
The program searches for a .txt document with a data vector on your PC, which is the registered muscle activity. It uses the sample frecuency to analyse and calculate the fundamental frequency using simple operators and fourier transform, to finally plot the vector and let the user see the results.
